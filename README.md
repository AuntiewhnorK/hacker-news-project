# Exploring Posts from Hacker News
A guided project from Dataquest about exploring posts from Hacker News site. It looks at two different types of Hackner News comment posts: Ask HN, for asking the community specific questions and Show HN, for showing the community projects or interesting things. The project explores whether different times recieve more Ask HN or Show HN posts. My goal for this project is gaining more experience with object oriented programming and working with dates and times in Python.
